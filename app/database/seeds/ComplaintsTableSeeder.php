                On the night of December 14, 2012, an informant called the NBI and said that he saw a boy resembling the kidnap-victim based on the photos given to informants. The boy was in the company of a man and a woman who entered the Cebuana Lluillier branch inside the Odeon Mall located at the corner of C.M. Recto and Rizal Avenue Sta. Cruz Manila. NBI operatives rushed to the place and they saw the duo in the company of a boy waiting for their turn to be serviced.

                 Sometime in February 2013, a client of Beauty Lane revealed that an unidentified person, later identified as Geroleo, was selling Brazillian Blowout products to them at discounted price. This prompted the client to inform Beauty Lane management about this development.
                
                To stop this illegal activity, the management arranged with said client to act in their behalf and continued negotiating for the purchase of their products at much lower price.
                
                On February 18, 2013, the client and Geroleo met at a mall in Makati for the purchase of the products at a much lower cost. Top management sought NBI assistance and an entrapment was planned.

At 3:00 P.M. suspect came with Layco on board a motorcycle. When Geroleo and the client met, the latter gave the marked money representing the cost of the agreed cost of the merchandise purchased. However, Geroleo sensed the unusual presence of the Bureau agents and attempted to escape in their motorcycle. Immediately alert NBI agents prevented their escape.

                 In 2000, Espelita obtained a loan of P303,500 for a reconditioned truck from Southeast Asia Motors Corp. (SAMC) in Valencia City, Bukidnon. As security for the loan, Espelita and his wife executed a blank real estate mortgage over a property covered by Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. AO-1554 registered under the complainant’s deceased father, Jose C. Espelita in favor of Philippine Farmers Bank (PFB).
                
                 The PFB was ordered closed by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas on 17 September 2009 and was under the receivership of the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC). Thereafter, complainant learned from PDIC that he has still outstanding loan balance which he needs to pay in order that the Official Receipt (OR) and Certificate of Registration (CR) of this truck will be given to him. However, he was also informed that OCT No. AO-1554 was marked “missing on file” and was not included in the inventory of titles which were turned-over to the PDIC.
                
                 On May 26, 2013, Cabardo visited Espelita in his residence in Kalilangan, Bukidnon and informed him that OCT No. A-1554 is in their possession. Cabardo then asked the complainant to redeem it for P6,000, the amount allegedly he still owed from the PFB including the so-called “SOP” amount of P3,000.
                
                Due to suspicion of irregularity, Espelita sought the advice of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) who endorsed the case to the NBI-AFAD because Cabardo has no authority to possess, transact nor convey the said OCT since all assets including collateral titles of borrowers of PFBI are deemed in custodia legis and should be turned over to the PDIC as statutory receiver.
                
                On June 4, 2013, Cabardo called Espelita to meet him in Valencia City, Bukidnon the next day if he is really keen in getting back the OCT. With this information, an entrapment was planned. The following day, NBI agents proceeded to the Manada Café in Sayre Highway, Poblacion, Valencia City, Bukidnon and positioned themselves strategically in the place. After a while, Cabardo arrived and sat in a table with Espelita.
                
                Thereafter, Cabardo handed to Espelita the receipt and copy of OCT at the same time Espelita gave the marked money to him. At this juncture, while the suspect was counting the marked money, complainant gave the pre-assigned signal to the operatives. They immediately approach Cabardo, and after introducing themselves, NBI agents placed Cabardo under arrest.
                
                En route to the NBI-NEMRO, Cabardo informed the complainant that he is still in possession of several titles which were allegedly mortgaged to PFB and was willing to surrender them. He then requested to call somebody who will deliver the titles. Eventually, a man arrived and gave a plastic envelope containing several land titles.

                On the last minute, Dela Concepcion changed the venue of the pay-off and the victims were told to meet her instead at Jollibee T. M. Kalaw, Manila branch at 6 A.M. on March 12, 2014 and hand over their full payment. Hence, an entrapment operation was planned.
                
                On March 12, 2014, at about 6:30 a.m. at the designated place, operatives of the NBI-LADO arrested Mary Jane V. Dela Concepcion while in the act of receiving the marked money from the six complainants.

The arrest of Ruben Lavilla alias Sheikh Omar is seen as a significant boost for the counter-terrorism campaign of the Philippine government and could be a major deterrent for the RSIM to regroup and reconsolidate its ranks.

                           Sheikh Omar is the only Islamic leader in the Philippines who can issue a verdict pertaining to punishment “in the service of Islam”. He is considered as one of the top ideologues of the RSIM which claimed affiliation with the Al Qaeda linked regional terrorist groups Jemaah Islamiyah and the Abu Sayyaf Group.

Authorities also said that Sheikh Omar may have been involved in the planning of several bomb attacks on the United States Embassy in Manila, all of which were disrupted by the Philippine National Police.

Even as PACC witnesses stated categorically that the allegations were false, Estrada and CISC's Chief Supt. Angel Quizon held on to their story. It has been suggested by observers and opinion writers that the contrivance was aimed to divert the focus from Calauan Mayor Antonio Sanchez who had been identified by witnesses as the principal suspect in the UPLB case. The cover-up was said to be motivated by PACC Task Force Habagat chief Panfilo Lacson and Estrada's links with Mayor Sanchez through jueteng payolas, cars supplied by the duo to Sanchez, and policemen identified with Sanchez who were with PACC).
                    
                    According to talks in the Upsilonian circle, PACC's Ike Gutierrez confided to a prominent Upsilonian that Sanchez had released P10 Million to Estrada, P10 Million to Lacson and P10 Million to media to draw the 'heat' away from him. Lacson has attempted to foist fabricated evidence on the case. This was rejected by the UP group which closed ranks and vigilantly insisted on the pursuit of justice; especially the parents of the murder victims, who rallied support for the Alqueza family. Despite recantation of PACC's two witnesses Corcolon and Lavadia who claimed to have been tortured to extract false testimony against Alqueza, vehement denial by third witness Rose Molina of PACC's love triangle theory, and statement by Centeno, driver of Sanchez, who pointed at Sanchez as the first to rape Sarmenta, Estrada and Lacson insisted that 19-year old Alqueza masterminded the crime by paying Lavadia the puny sum of P21,000 to carry out the murder.",

But by then the police prevented reporters from even getting near the bus.

                Mr. Mendoza gave an interview to Radio Mindanao Network, a Manila station, in which he admitted shooting two of the hostages and threatened to kill more. “I shot two Chinese,” he told the station in Tagalog, “I will finish them all if they do not stop.” The commandos struck after the bus driver jumped through a window and ran from the bus screaming, “Everybody is dead!”",

(PMC) and Union Bank of the Philippines (UBP). 
                         
                        Neri, it was gathered, is a Filipino Citizen with residential address at 28 Palali Street, Sta. Mesa Heights, Quezon City. As a Filipino citizen deriving income from within the Philippines, he is subject to income tax and is mandated to declare all his income for each taxable year and pay the corresponding taxes due thereon. 
                         
                        A comparison made by BIR investigators of the gross income or revenues declared by Neri in his ITRs for taxable years 2008 and 2009 as against the income payments he received from various corporations for the same years revealed that he deliberately failed to declare his correct tax base by substantially underdeclaring his income for two (2) consecutive taxable years.
